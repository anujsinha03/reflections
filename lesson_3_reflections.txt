Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. I will use remote repository to allow multiple users to work on my files collaboratively and in a defined way even if the users are available at remote 
   areas relative to each other.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. Because there might be a chance that the local repository have different names of different branches and we want to add the updates to the specific branches
   which may change every time. Along with that, it is no necessary that the head is checked out to the master branch.
