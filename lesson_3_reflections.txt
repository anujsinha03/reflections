Q. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A. I will use remote repository to allow multiple users to work on my files collaboratively and in a defined way even if the users are available at remote 
   areas relative to each other.

Q. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A. Because there might be a chance that the local repository have different names of different branches and we want to add the updates to the specific branches
   which may change every time. Along with that, it is no necessary that the head is checked out to the master branch.

Q. Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A. forks will clone a user public repository to the other user repository in the github itself. Clones will copy a user reposiroty from one place to other like
   github to local directory or from one local directory to the another local directory. Branches refer to the multiple versions of a source file with in each 
   branch, there are sume updates which will not affect the main code or the master branch.

Q. What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A. On having a copy of last known of remote, one can fetch the changes in remote and add it easily to the local directory by updating remote master and 
   merging it to master which will sort the collaboration conflict of remote and local.
