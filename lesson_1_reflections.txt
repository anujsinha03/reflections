Q. How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A. By looking at the previous versions, one can compare them for the changes between those two verions or keep track of the updates for the project purpose too.

Q. What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
   like Google Docs does?
A. pros are that one can commit the same kind of logical change at once but cons can be that the individual is working over a week for adding a new feature and 
   commiting after a week is too big to commit, instead one should divide the add-on feature into multiple logical features and commit them frequently.

Q. Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A. Git allows to tracking of multiple files by taking snapshots of the updates in all the files present in a repo in a togather manner whereas Google docs
   maintains the changes in the different files in a seprate manner.
